    CONSOLE APPLICATION : Multi_Objective_Genetic_Algorithm Project Overview
========================================================================

This simple C++ program computes a multi object hierarchical genetic algorrithm. 
The heirarchy gene is simply male or female and this is implicit in the structure
of the program (2 lists). Each pair of parents produce 1 male and 1 female offspring.

The individuals are awarded greater breeding rights if they climb highest up the hill 
surface - but there is one catch - the females are walking on a different hill
surface to the males.
